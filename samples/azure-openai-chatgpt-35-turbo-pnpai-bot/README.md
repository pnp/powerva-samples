## Features

This bot utilizes a Fallback topic to ensure prompts entered by the user are passed to a Power Automate Flow that calls an Azure OpenAI ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo endpoint. The current solution utilizes ChatML to create a running history of the conversation that is passed to the API so that the bot has the context of the current conversation with the user.

Users can type 'Restart' to reset the conversation at anytime.
